The IEO2003 expects much of the growth to occur in the developing world, with China, India, and South Korea leading the way, as their consumption increasingly resembles that of the industrialized world. (Figure 1).         Expectations for growth in Central and South America have been lowered substantially from those reflected in past editions of the Outlook. Political and economic problems surfacing among the nations of the region in the past year have tempered the previous, more optimistic outlook for their development.\u00a0 Unrest in Venezuela,\u00a0\u00a0 an Argentine economy that remains in crisis, and renewal of an aggressive campaign against insurgency groups by the Colombian government, all contribute to uncertainty about the region.\u00a0 These uncertainties have led to lower projections of the region\u2019s energy demand in this year\u2019s forecast.\u00a0 Whereas energy demand in Central and South America was projected to grow by 3.8 percent per year between 1999 and 2020 in last year\u2019s report, the IEO2003 reference case projects average annual growth of only 2.4 percent from 1999 to 2020.                Total world demand for oil is expected to rise by about 1.2 million barrels per day in 2003, as national economies begin to recover from the global economic slowdown in 2002.\u00a0 In the IEO2003\u00a0reference case projection, world oil consumption increases from 77 million barrels per day in 2001 to 119 million barrels per day in 2025, an annualized growth rate of 1.8 percent (Figure 2). The increases in worldwide oil use projected in the reference case would require an increase of\u00a0 42 million barrels per day over current productive capacity.\u00a0 OPEC producers are expected to be the major source of increased production, but non-OPEC supply is expected to remain competitive, with major growth in offshore resources, especially in the Caspian Basin, Latin America, and deepwater West Africa.

Worldwide capital expenditures of major U.S. energy companies also hit an all-time high, totaling $109.3 billion in 2000, up 90 percent from expenditures in 1999. Mergers and acquisitions accounted for nearly all of the growth in capital expenditures, and most of the merger and acquisition activity in 2000 involved transactions between the majors. Excluding the effects of mergers and acquisitions, capital expenditures increased by only 3 percent between 1999 and 2000.                Over 80 percent of the value of mergers and acquisitions in 2000 went for oil and gas production assets. The high level of capital expenditures for previously discovered oil and gas reserves is part of a recent trend among the majors. In recent years, the growth in the major energy companies' U.S. reserve base has come increasingly from mergers and acquisitions. By 2000, over 60 percent of the companies' total additions to reserves were gained in this way, up from an average of slightly over 10 percent in the 1990 to 1996 period (figure).          Nevertheless, the major energy companies' performance with the drill bit in 2000 was among the best in the 27 years spanned by EIA's Financial Reporting System. The majors' worldwide additions to their oil and gas reserves from exploration and development activities, mainly drilling, totaled 6.6 billion barrels (crude oil equivalent) in 2000. Only the 6.8 billion barrels added in 1997 exceeded this level. Worldwide reserve additions of the major energy companies exceeded worldwide oil and gas production by 22 percent in 2000. That is, the \"replacement ratio,\" an often-used measure of exploration and development performance, equaled 122 percent in 2000, again the second best since at least 1974.
